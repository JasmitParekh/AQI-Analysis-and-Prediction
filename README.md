## AQI Analysis and Prediction

This repository contains a Data Science project focused on analyzing and predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI). The project leverages various data science methodologies to provide insights into air quality conditions and trends. The key features of this project include:

- **Data Collection:** Compilation of air quality data from reliable monitoring stations.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming data to ensure accuracy.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualization of AQI trends across different states and years.
- **Model Building:** Development of a Linear Regression model to predict AQI based on pollutant levels.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessment of model performance using metrics such as RÂ² and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Implementation:** Deployment strategies for making the model accessible.

### Contents
- **AQI.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis and model development.
- **Data:** Folder containing the dataset used for analysis.
- **Visualizations:** Plots and graphs illustrating key insights from the data.
- **README.md:** Detailed project description and instructions.

### Usage
Clone the repository and run the Jupyter notebook to explore the AQI analysis and prediction process. The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of air quality and support informed decision-making for public health and environmental protection.
